Check for High Load Average issue, below are some of the measures and steps to follow.

1.  "top" or "htop" 
    Identify the running processes with this command to look for the processes consuming high CPU, memory and I/O. Pay attention to "%CPU" and "%MEM" columns.

2.  "uptime" 
    Use this command to look for high numbers in the load average indicating the system is overloaded.

3.  "isostat"
    Use this command to monitor the I/O devices and check the load on the disc. 

4.  "free -m"
    Use this command to check fo the total, used and available memory including swap memory usage.

5.  "df -h"
    Use this command to check for the disk utilization then add or remove disk accordingly.

By systematically using these commands, you can identify the primary cause of the high load on the server. Each command provides insights into different aspects of system
performance, from CPU and memory usage to disk I/O. Once you identify the bottleneck, you can take appropriate actions such as optimizing processes, upgrading hardware, or 
configuring system parameters to resolve the issue.
